### Wireframe mockups
To produce a basic mockup of the site layouts I used Balsamiq.

* [Submission page wireframe](assests/images/design/wireframesSubmit.png)
* [Highscores page wireframe](assests/images/design/wireframesHighscores.png)


### Design

Following the overall structure of the wireframes being established, I first researched other sports quiz websites to find what the current most popular sites are. In this case the most popular were all sections of news websites e.g. [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/series/sports-quiz-of-the-week), [The Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/gerwyn-price-tom-brady-anthony-joshua-australian-open-super-bowl-lv-b1977108.html) and [BBC Sport](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/59731273).

From the above research I decided to take inspiration from popular free quiz apps such as "General Knowledge Quiz" by Trivia and "General Knowledge Trivia Quiz" by GK questions and answers game. Both of which have a simple and clear User Interface for the questions. 

### Color Scheme

The color scheme design focus was based around the image I decided upon from the following shortlist from shutterstock:
* [Blue and White](assests/images/blue-white.webp)
* [Yellow and Dark Green](assests/images/yellow-blue.webp)
* [Multi-Color Sports](assests/images/multiColorSports.jpg)

I decided upon the Blue and White image, as it is reminiscent of the current social media football style of paint strokes with players over the top. 

I decided to color match the dark blue of the image using [imagecolorpicker.com](https://imagecolorpicker.com/)

The main text color used was white as this had one of the best constrasts when tested with [WebAIM](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/)

For the hover over effects I invert the colors to clearly shows the user the option selected.

Standard Green and Red colors were used to show when a question was correct or incorrect respectively.

Green was used as the progress bar as it gave a hugh contrast to the rest of the colors across the website.

### Typography

The font used for all bodies of text was Roboto to carry a consistent visual and was imported from google fonts.
