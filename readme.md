### Wireframe mockups
To produce a basic mockup of the site layouts I used Balsamiq. 

* [Home page wireframe](assests/wireframes/homepage-wireframe.png)
* [Overview page wireframe](assests/wireframes/overview-wireframe.png)
* [Character Creation page wire frame](assests/wireframes/charactercreation-wireframe.png)
* [Contact page wire frame](assests/wireframes/contact-wireframe.png)

There were necessary deviations from the wireframe regarding copyright concerns, initally I had aimed to include a youtube video that users could interact with and watch however looking further into YouTubes copyright terms and coditions I was unsure if this would be fair use so have instead removed it and kept a clickable link that sends you straight to the youtube video by How to be a Great DM.

* [UX of Soundcloud and Youtube link](assests/media/ux-changes/link-only.png)


### Design

Following the overall structure of the wireframes being established, I first set out to find stock images that would relate to a niche horror fantasy without compromising on the aesthetic. I needed a hero image that immediately caught the userâ€™s focus and explained the webpage on its own. After going through unsplash and pexels for a couple of days I was able to find what matched the asthetic I was targetting on shutterstock [https://www.shutterstock.com/](https://www.shutterstock.com/g/WarmTail?searchterm=)

* [Image Collection](assests/media/image-collage.png)
* [Final Image](assests/images/hero-2560.jpg)

### Color Scheme

The image then dictated the color scheme design focus, the goal then became to have striking contrasts that mentally relate to horror but for a contrasting perspective, I needed to clear visible text as the purpose of the website is to draw the user in and give them the information they want to come back to.

By testing different rgba shades of red to match up with my hero image I chose I compared contrasting colors using [https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) of which white (#FFFFFF) gave a good contrast. 

To give a container contrast for the main body of text I used a grey background color which gave a suitable contrast ratio, however later on in development this was changed to black. The black to white contrast is the highest contrast and suited the theme of the website and the goal of making the information stand out.

    ![Banner Card](assests/media/ux-changes/banner-card.png)

* ### Text Container

    - Each page's body of text is incased in this container it ensures the design remains consistent across the site.
    - This is made fully responsive where at 1024px the container expands to the full page width prevent the text from looking squashed in.

## Home Page Features

*    ### Hero Image 
        - The home page has a hero image to width and height of the full scrren. As previously stated in the design section this is to draw the user in.
        - The hero image is fully responsive so the figure in the image remains center of the screen at all time. 
        - The hero image contains the title of the website which is contained within a fully responsive div element, this changes position and font size dependant on screen width.
        - The hero image as contains an interactive button which animates when hovered over or clicked, this is also fully responsive and caused an interesting bug which will be addressed in the bug section of this document.

![Hero Image](assests/media/hero-image-read.png)

* ### Home Page Information Section
    - Taking inspiration from the [call of duty vanguard website](https://www.callofduty.com/content/atvi/callofduty/vanguard/web/en_gb/home.html), the sections of text have been separated and style in 4 separate divs to control the position and stagger the text. 
    - Images that correlate to the banner of each page sit above their related counter part e.g. the warrior holding a torch is above "Story" the banner for the Story section is that image.
    - Learn more buttons have been added which light up when hovered over and are linked to the id of the specific section directing the user to specific sections of the site.
    - The sections are responsive under both the 1024px media query and at 768px where the sections sit one on top of the over giving a clean user interface the difference can be seen in the links below..

    ![Contact Form Image](assests/media/contact.png)

<h1 align="center">Future-Enhancements</h1>

The future intention of this webpage would be to enable users to create their own characters using the webpage, share stories or images of themselves enjoying the campaign to build a bigger community.

- ### Future Goals:

* Website design and layout: 
    - Addition of more images or fanart to break up the campaign section. 
    - Addition of the linked youtube video and soundcloud to the website, this would required a response from the current creators. 
    - Seperate the contact form into another webpage and have a dedicated community page which would display fanart or community events. 
    - Add the remaining races and classes from the basic free to use D&D 5e adventure book.

* Functionality:
    - Introduce a section where users can propose new races or classes via a submission form which would then link to a database.
    - Introduce a section as part of the character creation that allows users to input a desired character name chose from a drop down menu their class and race. The site would take that input to randomly generate the numbers for the stats on a character sheet taking into account the users chosen race/class and produce and downloaded character sheet. 
    - Feedback section, where users can share difficulties in the campaign which is then logged into a database that can correlate responses to show where sections of the campaign requires rebalancing. 

* Long term:
    - The long term goal of the website is to gian enough traffic where the homepage can advertise multiple campaigns where the users can select a campaign they like the look off be able to generate a new character or have their current one modified (if required to suit) and download a copy of the campaign. 


<h1 align="center">Testing</h1>

I carried out continuous testing as the site was being developed. Once a git commit was carried out I would then test the site using chrome dev tools. This in theory allowed me to confirm the styling was being applied correctly however, I had ignored to test for responsive design until midway through the development cycle resulting in many interactions not working as intended and required serveral fixes, the more interesting fixes shown below. 

* Issue 1: Popup for classes snapping to the top of the page what the window was closed. 
   - [Faulty code](assests/images/codefixes/issue-1.1.png)
   - [Image of Fault 1](assests/images/codefixes/issue-1.2.png)
   - [Image of Fault 2](assests/images/codefixes/issue-1.3.png)
* Solution: The href being "#" was forcing the view to return to the top of the page, by giving both href and the anchor tage an id to return back to the screen remains in place.

* Issue 2: The whole homepage was being offset to the left once the screen width was shrunk to <600px leaving a continuous bar on the right of the page that increased in size while pushing the content to the left of the page. 
* Soloution: Interestingly I haven't been able to recreate this bug I inspected the element and saw that the container my animated button was in ignored the boundary set by the container above that, by removing the float property and adjusting the padding and width of the containers affecting the button the content now remains in the correct place. 

Once I believed the site to be complete I shared it amongst friends and family to get a large sample size of different devices to find out any issues encoutered or anything they didn't like from a user perspective, the messages can be seen below and I have been given permission to shared then in the context the chat and names are covered. 

* [Feedback 1](assests/media/ux-changes/messenger-feedback1.png)
* [Feedback 2](assests/media/ux-changes/messenger-feedback2.png)

Additional testing carried out using the chrome developer tools was to keep dragging the resolution across to find breakpoints where sections would overlap or spacing issues, a regular occurence from this was linehieghts and margin spacing, to overcome this instead of using pixels to determine heights and widths I used percentages or viewport heights where required.

Physical testing by myself was carried out with the following devices:
* Desktop Computer: 1920 x 1080 & 1280 x 720
    - Mozilla Firefox
    - Google Chrome
* Microsoft Surface Pro 2: 1920 x 1080
    - Google Chrome
* iPhone XR: 828 x 1792
    - Safari


<h1 align="center">Validator Testing</h1>

* ## HTML 
    - Two re-occurring errors came up when initally validating.
        - [First Error](assests/media/error.png) which was fixed by removing the achor tag as it was unecessary with the set ID, this error I requested help from slack. 
        - Second error was reusing IDs of the same value, where possible these were changed to classes and others the IDs where numerically changed. 

    - Final validation testing where no errors occured.

* ## Lighthouse
    - I generated a lighthouse report for the deployed site through the google extension. 
    - The inital report came back clear with one error regarding an image containers in my nav bar which  didn't have description. Resolved issues report below:

    ![Desktop Report](assests/media/lighthouse-report.png)

    - See below for mobile generated report through the google extension lighthouse
    - I was able to improve performance to 80% on mobile devices, with the only way to increase perfomance is "Serve static assets with an efficient cache policy"

    ![Lighthouse report for mobile](assests/media/final-mobile.png)
